    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>You see, in those days, chickens laid eggs and people sometimes ate them. This is a tradition that carries on even to today. Believe it or not, in the time it took you to read this sentence, it's likely that at least one chicken somewhere in the world has laid an egg.</p>
    <p>So anyway, back to my childhood. When I was a child, sometimes I ate eggs that were hardboiled. Here's the recipe.</p>
