    <h2>These recipes may be a lot of work, but they're worth it!</h2>
    <p>Imagine the satisfaction you'll feel when you <strong>single-handedly</strong> transform the most basic ingredients into an intricate meal fit for a king, or perhaps another type of ruler. Maybe the ruler of a small village. Ok, maybe not the <em>ruler</em> of a small village, but someone who lives in, or near, yes let's say near, a small village. These meals are <em>definitely</em> fit for someone who lives near a small village.</p>
    <p>Note: don't actually cook single-handedly. Use both hands whenever possible.</p>
